# The recipe's TUNE and MENTAT knobs as gr8's options, sourced by entrypoint.sh and bin/gr8 so every gr8 command sees
# the same.
#   TUNE=speed (default): the settings measured in README.md. The release's bit349 manifest (K3, with K4 where it
#             counts most), eight sessions sharing a 2,097,152-token KV pool, requests up to 262,144 tokens.
#   TUNE=context: the same, plus context-parallel KV (GR8_CP=1 in EXTRA_ENV) and requests up to 1,048,576 tokens. With
#             a smaller CAP, set MAX_MODEL_LEN too: at most CAP less the guard rows.
#   TUNE=quality: the release's K4 width, four sessions sharing a 262,208-token pool, requests up to 262,144 tokens.
#   A VARIANT, SESS, CAP or MAX_MODEL_LEN set on its own keeps its value, and so does a GR8_CP already in EXTRA_ENV.
#   MENTAT=0 (default): the two boxes from PEERS (their LAN addresses, head first) and, if set, IPS and IPS2 (each box's
#             fabric address on the first and second ConnectX root, in PEERS order). Nothing is announced.
#   MENTAT=1: find the other box through the host's mentat daemon (gr8's MENTAT=localhost) and announce the API in the
#             mentat cluster, in group GROUP (gr8-glm53f-2x by default, so the pair never joins another Flash cluster).
